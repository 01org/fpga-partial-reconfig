Compilation was done using Quartus 20.3.

To compile the design from a command line:

(You may want to comment out some of the PR persona revision compiles as the 
adder* PR persona revisions take a long time to compile)

> run_compile.sh


To compile the design from the gui:

> quartus blinking_led.qpf &

Then press the compile button to compile the blinking_led base revision.

After compiling the base revions, you can compile the PR persona revisions by
changing the revision and doing a compile for that revision.


The base revision compilation (blinking_led) will create a design where pipelined 
buses run through a 3x4 sector PR region containing the blinking_led design from 
the PR Tutorial. Rows and columns are carved out of the PR region to accomodate 
the pipelined bus which uses ALM flops. Opening the Chip Planner after 
compilation best shows the structure.

There are 5 PR persona revisions included in this design that can be compiled for
the PR region. The pipelined bus structure is the same for all since it is part
of the static region. The PR personas are:

1) blinking_led_default (same as PR tutorial)
2) blinking_led_empty   (same as PR tutorial)
3) blinking_led_slow    (same as PR tutorial)
4) adder_grid_1d	(artificial systolic adder array)
5) adder_grid_2d	(more complicated artificial systolic adder array)
