Compilation was done using Quartus 20.3.

To compile the design from a command line:
> run_compile.sh

To compile the design from the gui:
> quartus soft_noc.qpf &
Then press the compile button

This compilation will create a design where small islands of ingress/egress 2 
MLAB/1 LAB based FIFOs are inserted as islands of static logic inside the 3x4 
sector PR region containing the blinking_led design from the PR Tutorial. The 
static compile contains these FIFOs and pipelined buses connected to the FIFOs. 
The pipelined bus uses HyperFlex registers and routing through the PR region to
reach the FIFO islands. Opening the Chip Planner after compilation best shows 
the structure.

The included directory tcl_gen contains scripts that were used to create the 
SystemVerilog and QSF.
